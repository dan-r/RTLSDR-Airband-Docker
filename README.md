# RTLSDR-Airband-Docker
Docker image for [szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband](https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband).

The sample configuration file is copied to /config when the container is run, and you will need to modify this file to suit your environment. See the [RTLSDR-Airband Wiki](https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband/wiki) for more info.

This has only been tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 and with an RTL-SDR dongle.

I've provided a docker-compose.yml as that is how I run this image.
