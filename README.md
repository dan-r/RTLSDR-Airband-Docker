# RTLSDR-Airband-Docker
Docker image for [charlie-foxtrot/RTLSDR-Airband](https://github.com/charlie-foxtrot/RTLSDR-Airband). This image is also hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/danr31/rtlsdr-airband).

The sample configuration file is copied to /config when the container is run, and you will need to modify this file to suit your environment. See the [RTLSDR-Airband Wiki](https://github.com/charlie-foxtrot/RTLSDR-Airband/wiki) for more info.

This has only been tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 and with an RTL-SDR dongle.

I've provided a docker-compose.yml as that is how I run this image.
